baredo: a redo[1] build system implementation.

baredo (bare-redo) differs from other redo implementations in that it is aimed to
reflect the simplicity, usability, efficiency and completeness of redo's design.
This is why no other "features" are planned to be implemented and it is
considered complete in its current state. (though flags for not printing
status lines, etc. could be considered)

[1]: https://cr.yp.to/redo.html

Requires a POSIX-compatible environment that can compile C99 code,
but no external dependencies.

Commands implemented: redo, redo-ifchange, redo-ifcreate, redo-infofor.

redo-infofor is just a helper and .do files shouldn't rely on its existatnce.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

baredo's behaviour is described in the redo.1 manpage, which you can view
localy (after having cloned the repo) with

	$ man -l redo.1

BUILDING
--------

First run
	$ ./gencc # reads CC,... from its enviromnent

Then, you can use redo, if available, to build with

	$ redo all

or, bootstrap with

	$ ./bootstrap

INSTALLING
----------

Install commands to /pref/bin and man page to /manpref/man1 with

	./install -c/pref/bin -m/manpref/man1

The ./install script can be used to (un)install the commands and the manual
page seperately, e.g. uninstall only commands from /path/dir with

	./install -c/path/dir
